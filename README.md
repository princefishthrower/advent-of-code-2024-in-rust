# Advent of Code 2024 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 in Rust. 

Each day of AoC is organized into its own folder with the input and the solution file. 

Each solution file has a `run_a` and `run_b` function, for each part of the problem.

Note: To run these solutions, you'll need an `input.txt` in each given day folder (they are ignored due to Advent of Code guidelines)
